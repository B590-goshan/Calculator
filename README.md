# Calculator

\# Project 1

This is a basic calculator application designed for Android using Kotlin and XML
It emulates the functionality of a typical smartphone calculator, enabling users to effortlessly perform fundamental arithmetic calculations

## **Features**  

The following **core functionalities** have been implemented:  

* A fully functional calculator layout with buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and special functions.  
* Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
* Users can reset the calculator using the `C` button.  
* Users can toggle the sign of a number with the `+/-` button.  
* Users can compute percentages using the `%` button.  
* Users see real-time updates of their input in the top `TextView`.  
* Decimal numbers are supported via the `.` button.  
* Users can enter continuous calculations without needing to press `=` after each operation.  

### **Additional Enhancements:**  

* Division by zero is managed gracefully by displaying `"Error"` instead of crashing the app.  
* Prevents unnecessary leading zeros (e.g., entering `0005` is automatically formatted as `5`).  
* Real-time calculations are updated dynamically as the user enters numbers and operators.  

## **Demo Walkthrough**  

Below is a walkthrough demonstrating the app’s functionality:

## **Challenges & Fixes**  

### **Layout Issues**  
GridLayout wasn’t properly expanding, causing some buttons to be misaligned.  

### **Handling Edge Cases**  
- **ZeroDivisionError**: It will displays `"Error"` and doesnt crash.  
- **Decimal Point Validation**: Multiple decimal points in a single number input.
